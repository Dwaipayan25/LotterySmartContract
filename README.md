# LotterySmartContract
# Lottery project (Solidity)

U can open this in remix IDE

Steps I have considered
1. Manager→to control the lottery
2. Participants→to take part in lottery
3. Participants have to buy lottery
4. Participants will send 2 ether to contract address
5. once he buys the lottery, his address will be registered
6. For lottery to start participants≥3
7. The one who randomly wins the lottery will get the whole prize money of the contract
8. Manager will have full control of the lottery
9. The lottery will be reset once 1 round is completed

Points:
- Participants must have wallet and have >=2 ether balance
- A participant can transfer ether more than 2,i.e. he can buy more than 1 lottery
